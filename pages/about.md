Each year Joan attends extra classes, making sure that she is not only up-to-date with the latest research but so that she can offer her patients the best possible advice and skills.

Does your naturopath do this?

Joan has attended classes for the past 20 years with Health World, because they lead the world in natural field research and keeping the practitioner informed.

This quest to stay educated means that you can be confident in her ability to get results. Quickly.

Joan is also an advocate of using the latest equipment to assist in any treatment.

This combination of knowledge and equipment means that Joan can now achieve results in a much shorter time frame than was previously possible.

Over her career Joan has seen many changes in attitudes and health issues, however her overriding belief to build health via detoxing.

This belief has only been re-enforced with so many people now suffering liver stress.

Joan can now also improve immune system problems that have become a major problem for many people.
