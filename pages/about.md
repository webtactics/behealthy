Under the banner of BeHealthy with Joan Goldsmith, she continually enhances her knowledge through annual attendance at supplementary classes. This commitment not only ensures she remains current with the latest developments but also enables her to provide her patients with the most informed advice and skills available.

Unlike many, Joan has consistently pursued educational opportunities with Health World for the past two decades. Health World is at the forefront of natural field research, setting the standard for keeping practitioners well-informed.

This dedication to ongoing education instils confidence in Joan's ability to deliver results swiftly. Moreover, she advocates for the integration of the latest equipment to enhance treatment efficacy. The synergy of her extensive knowledge and cutting-edge tools enables Joan to achieve results in a significantly shorter timeframe than previously possible.

Throughout her career, Joan has witnessed shifts in attitudes and health challenges. Her unwavering belief in building health through detoxification remains a constant. This conviction has been reinforced by the increasing prevalence of liver stress among individuals.

In a notable transition, Joan has recently moved from Mooloolaba to operate as an online-only business. Despite this shift, she continues to bring her accumulated expertise and the latest advancements in the field to address immune system problemsâ€”a widespread issue affecting many individuals.
